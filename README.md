Overview
In today's fast-paced world, staying organized is crucial. TaskyApp provides a clean and user-friendly interface to manage your to-do lists effectively. Whether you're managing personal errands or tracking work-related projects, TaskyApp offers the flexibility and power you need, all from your mobile device.

Key Features
Task Management: The core functionality allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks effortlessly.

Due Dates & Reminders: Set deadlines for your tasks to stay on track. The app can provide reminders for upcoming tasks (implementation note: background tasks for push notifications would require additional native setup).

Priority Levels: Categorize your tasks with priority levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High) to focus on what matters most.

Task Categorization: Organize tasks into custom categories or projects for better structure and overview.

Persistent Storage: All your tasks and settings are saved locally on your device using AsyncStorage, ensuring your data is always available, even offline.

User Interface: Built with a focus on user experience, featuring a responsive design that works smoothly on both iOS and Android platforms. Supports both Light and Dark themes.

Technology Stack
TaskyApp is built using a modern React Native development stack:

Framework: React Native

State Management: Redux Toolkit (RTK) - for efficient and predictable state management across the application.

Navigation: React Navigation - provides a seamless and native-like navigation experience between screens (e.g., Stack Navigator).

Storage: AsyncStorage - for persisting user data locally on the device.

Icons: React Native Vector Icons - provides a wide set of customizable icons for a polished UI.
